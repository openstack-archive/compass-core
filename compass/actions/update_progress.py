       In the function, it will update the database cluster_state and
       host_state table for the deploying cluster and hosts.

       the lastest installing progress and the position of log it has
       processed in the last run. The function uses these information to
       avoid recalculate the progress from the beginning of the log file.
       After the progress got updated, these information will be stored back
       to the log_progressing_history for next time run.
